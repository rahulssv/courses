    HTML - Transition Property
    "Pink Frag Event Organizer" are conducting an online contest for choosing the Best website of the year. The topic for the contest is to develop an innovative webpage for a Wedding Event. Shiyas has registered for the contest and started developing a web page with the contents related to the Wedding Event. He planned to create something new and started surfing about transition property in CSS, as it is capable of producing a transition effect in the image on hovering.

    Being a beginner in designing the websites, he needs your help to finish the web page for the contest by using the transition property in CSS.
    Hints :  overflow property  The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area. hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible Syntax :    overflow: visible|hidden|scroll|auto|initial|inherit;   Transition property CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration. The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect. ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default) Syntax :    transition-property: none|all|property|initial|inherit;  width property The width property sets the width of an element. Syntax :    width: auto|value|initial|inherit;
    Refer the below gif for designing the web page.

    A wedding is a ceremony where two people or a couple are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by the couple, presentation of a gift (offering, ring(s), symbolic item, flowers, money), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony.
